            <article>
                <ul class="information">
                    <li><p><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa </p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era<br> 
                        program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping <br>
                        starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by<br>                                
                        Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding <br>
                        pest-resistent plants.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,<br> 
                        the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and<br> 
                        other applied science.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico<br> 
                        to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of<br> 
                        disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p><span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a<br> 
                        strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time<br> 
                        to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                    <li><p><span>1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified <br>
                        crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not <br>
                        inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long <br>
                        before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</p></li>
